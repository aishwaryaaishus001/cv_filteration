        - Return only simple, clear, and common keywords that anyone can quickly understand.
        - Do NOT return full sentences or complex terms.
        - For Skills and Education, select directly from the lists if relevant.
        - For Projects, Certifications, and Experience:
          - Analyze the full entries from the database.
          - Extract ONLY simple, easy-to-understand keywords relevant to the job.
          - If no clear matches, you may add AI-suggested simple keywords relevant to the job.
        - Output a clean JSON object with 5 fields:
